<h1>Mathulator</h1>

<p>Mathulator depends on the <a href="https://github.com/EanLombardo/libICMath">libICMath</a> project, which is also written by me, just for Mathulator.</p>

<p>My first Java project and my first Android project, Mathulator is an Android application designed to one day replace modern graphing calculators. The reason the application was developed is because even in 2010 the idea of paying for an expensive graphing calculator was beginning to get ridiculous. More and more people were beginning to get mobile devices, and a mobile device could handle more powerful computation and give users a much better experience with graphs as they would have a touchscreen. Mathulator was built from the ground up, with every single line of code written by me including my own custom made mathematical computation library. As I learned more and more about Java and computer science in general I realized the design decisions I made in high school, with no computer science education, were non optimal, and the entire application had to be refactored. The new design for the application was 10x as powerful and likely would have removed much of the bottlenecks the application faced. The newly designed application however, is too much for one person to develop, so the project&rsquo;s development halted.</p>
