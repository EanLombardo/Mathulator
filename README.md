<p>My first Java project and my first Android project was &ldquo;Mathulator&rdquo;. Mathulator was an Android application designed to one day replace modern graphing calculators. This application was developed 2010 when I realized a mobile device was more powerful, could handle more complex computations and presented a better graphing experience with a touch screen, than an expensive graphing calculator. Mathulator was built from the ground up, with every single line of code written by me including my own custom made mathematical computation library called&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/EanLombardo/libICMath">libICMath</a>. As I learned more and more about Java and computer science in general I realized the design decisions I made before I had any&nbsp;computer science education, were non-optimal, and the entire application had to be refactored. The new design for the application is&nbsp;10 times as powerful and likely would have remove much of the bottlenecks the application faces. The newly designed application however, is too much for one person to develop, so the project&rsquo;s development&nbsp;on hold.</p> <p><strong>Features</strong></p> <ul> <li> <p>Standard mathematical expression evaluation</p> </li> <li> <p>Standard set of mathematical functions (sin, cos, abs, ln ect.)</p> </li> <li> <p>Numerical derivative evaluation</p> </li> <li> <p>Numerical integral evaluation</p> </li> <li> <p>Interactive multi-function graphing</p> </li> <li> <p>Interactive graphing of numerical derivatives</p> </li> <li> <p>Interactive graphing of numerical integrals</p> </li> <li> <p>Autocomplete like system for variables and functions when typing</p> </li> <li> <p>Analytics reporting statement evaluation times and user engagement</p> </li> </ul>
